# Extending the Basic JWKS Server
![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-blue)

---

## **Overview**  
This project extends the basic JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) server by integrating SQLite for persistent key storage. This enhancement ensures that private keys remain available even if the server is restarted or moved. The implementation also focuses on preventing SQL injection attacks and improving security by enforcing proper database interactions.  
By utilizing SQLite, the JWKS server now supports:  
- Secure storage and retrieval of RSA private keys.  
- Proper key expiration handling.  
- JWT issuance using keys stored in a database.  
- Resilience against SQL injection.

## üìå Requirements  
‚úÖ Store RSA key pairs in a SQLite database (`totally_not_my_privateKeys.db`).  
‚úÖ Ensure private keys are persisted and remain available across server restarts.  
‚úÖ Secure database interactions to prevent SQL injection attacks.  
‚úÖ Modify `/auth` and `/jwks` endpoints to use the database for key management.  
‚úÖ Implement a test suite with over 80% coverage.  
‚úÖ Ensure compatibility with black-box testing.

## **üìå Endpoints**

| **Method** | **Endpoint**             | **Description**                           |  
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |  
| `GET`      | `/.well-known/jwks.json` | Returns active public keys in JWKS format |  
| `POST`     | `/auth`                  | Returns a signed JWT                      |  
| `POST`     | `/auth?expired=true`     | Returns a JWT signed with an expired key  |

## **üöÄ Installation & Setup**

### **Prerequisites**  
- Python (Ensure you have Python installed)  
- Flask (Web framework)  
- PyJWT (JWT Library)

```bash  
python -m pytest --cov=server --cov-report=term server_test_suite.py 
```

## **üõ† How It Works**

### **Database Integration**  
- The server creates and manages an SQLite database (`totally_not_my_privateKeys.db`).  
- Keys are stored with unique `kid` values and expiration timestamps.  
- Expired keys are not served by the JWKS endpoint.

### **JWT Signing Process**  
- The `/auth` endpoint retrieves a valid key from the database to sign a JWT.  
- If `expired=true` is provided, an expired key is used.  
- JWTs contain standard claims such as `sub`, `iat`, and `exp`.

### **Security Measures**  
- SQL queries use parameterized statements to prevent injection attacks.  
- Database connections are securely handled and closed after each transaction.  
- JWTs are signed with RSA keys using the RS256 algorithm.
